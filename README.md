## Gameplay
Play Battleship against the computer! 
You will start by placing your 5 ships on you board. For each ship you will choose whether to place it horizontally or vertically and then select the row and column it will be placed at. If you chose for a ship to be placed horizontally, it will be placed starting at your chosen row and column and continuing to the left. If you chose for a ship to be placed vertically, it will be placed starting at your chosen row and column and continuing down.
Once you finish placing all of your ships, the computer will place its ships and then you will begin guessing. After each guess, you will be told if it was a miss, a hit, or a sink. You and the computer will continue going back and forth guessing until one of you has won the game!
